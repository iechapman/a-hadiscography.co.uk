<P><B>Germany:</B> Limited numbers of the LP came with a free band poster. It is a 55cm x 55cm black and white poster of the band members, wearing leather jackets and standing in front of an old fashioned silver microphone - the same poster which came with limited numbers of the 12&quot; single of &quot;Stay On These Roads&quot;.
<P><B>Germany / E.U.:</B> There are several different German made CD pressings. The first and second pressings are very similar with slightly different copyright and record company information on the back sleeve with the information on the second pressing being slightly longer with the additional text &quot;.. Unauthorized Copying, Hiring, Lending, Public Performance And Broadcasting Of This Record Prohibited. Manufactured in Germany. Presse en Allemagne. Record Service GmbH. Alsdorf A Warner Communications Company&quot; rather than &quot;.. Unauthorised duplication is a violation of application laws.&quot;. This text and WB logo are printed in lighter colours on the second pressing. The discs are the same but some(?) of the re-pressings have a different, 725733-2.4 RSA (Record Service GmbH, Alsdorf) matrix number on them, rather than the original 925 733-2 P+O-B (P+O Compact Disc GmbH &amp; Co. KG). 
<P>The E.U. pressing is similar to the first German pressing but with a different catalogue number, the French part being WE 835 rather than the usual WE 851, and matrix number (925 733-2 P+O-C.) and the text &quot;Manufactured in Germany by Record Service GmbH, Alsdorf&quot; on the disc has been changed to &quot;Made In Germany&quot;. The catalogue number on the back sleeve doesn't have the word &quot;France&quot; printed before the number WE 835. Some copies come with a yellow round exclamation sticker on the front of the case. This E.U. edition is almost identical to that used in the UK except that the UK edition has the word &quot;France&quot; on the back sleeve. Another E.U. pressing is similar to the first, but has the full catalogue number, not just the second part, printed on the back of the insert booklet and on the spine. The matrix number is 759925733-2 WME, rather than the RSA one.

The track listing and WB logo are printed in black, rather than blue with different record company and copyright information stating that it is made in the E.U. The catalogue number, usually displayed in the top right hand corner of the back sleeve has been omitted. The full catalogue number is printed on the spine, rather than just the last part, but there the French number is not printed on the cover or disc.
Another E.U. copy has the full catalogue number printed on the back sleeve and disc with the French number WE 851 on the back sleeve. The matrix code is 925733-2.4 RSA.

<P><B>Uruguay:</B> The cover of the Uruguay cassette is black with a square purple-tone picture as found on the European releases.
<IMG WIDTH="117" HEIGHT="150" SRC="albums/sotr_urcas.jpg" ALT="Stay On These Roads Uruguay cassette (front cover and spine)" ALIGN="RIGHT">
The spine and front cover have a white a-ha logo and the title is printed in purple. A large gold colour circled &quot;32&quot; is printed at the bottom of the spine. The lyrics are not printed on the cover, just a basic track list printed on a white background. The cassette is white with light blue labels with black text. This release doesn't look very official - to be confirmed.
<P><B>USA:</B> The cover of the album differs slightly from the German made release as the cover photo has been printed very dark. On the LP, the title and a-ha logo are printed lower down on the sleeve. Some copies of the CD come in a long box.</P>

<P>There is a US CD pressing made by Discovery Systems. It is similar to the European release with a few minor differences. The CD booklet has the catalogue number printed in white at the bottom right hand cornet of the back cover and on page 10, it says Printed in U.S.A. The disc has the U.S. copyright and record company information on the left hand side of the disc, rather than around the outer rim. The back sleeve doesn't have the catalogue information in the top right hand corner and the WB logo is light blue, rather than dark.</P>

The cover of this Japanese only mini album has a group studio picture with a yellow and pink title logo on a blue background. The CD insert folds out with the lyrics, and individual pictures of the 3 band members (Magne being on the back of the insert). The CD comes with a white obi strip with red, blue and black text. 
<P>The CD features a group shot as found on the UK 12&quot; picture disc of &quot;The Blood That Moves The Body&quot;.</P>

<P>There are 2 slightly different obi-strips for this mini Japanese album. The differences are very subtle - one has three lines of text at the top of the obi, whilst the other has two. The one with 3 lines of text has 2 different prices printed at the bottom of the spine, the other has just one price. Otherwise these releases seem to be exactly the same with same catalogue numbers.

This Brazilian only release has a colour photo cover of the band. The reverse of the LP is blue with three small a-ha pictures. It comes with an LP-sized fold-out card with the picture from the cover and a picture of Morten holding a cup and a picture of P&aring;l and Magne sitting on reels inside. The reverse features pictures of the three previous albums.</P>

<P><IMG WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="301" SRC="albums/otib_cd2.jpg" ALT="On Tour In Brazil CD - reverse of insert" ALIGN="RIGHT">

The back insert is light blue with a mirror image of the large a-ha logo used on the front sleeve on the left hand side. The track list is printed in black down the centre and there is even a gap between &quot;Maybe Maybe&quot; and &quot;Hunting High And Low&quot; indicating that it uses the same artwork as the LP. The disc is plain with black text. The a-ha logo and title are at the top, with the track list on the right hand side and record company information on the left hand side.</P>
<P>There are a very limited number of test pressings which have the same catalogue number. They come with picture sleeve and fold-out poster. The disc label is almost plain white disc label with a small amount of text.</P>
